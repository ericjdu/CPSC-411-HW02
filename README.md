Homework assignment number 2. Eric Du

I'm very sorry professor, I was unable to complete either of the two version of the assignment, both the programming and storyboard versions. I have reached my physical and mental limits, and my virtual mac computer session keeps ending before I find any meaningful progress.

I attempted to repurpose code from both the Claim and Person code examples, but the code would only function with the person naming conventions, so I have tried my best to code using the Person variable names.

My storyboard attempt contains the storyboard's progress and unfinished code in the UIEditor file. The program will no longer compile in its current state. I'm so sorry, Professor.
