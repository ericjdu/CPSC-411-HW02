Homework assignment number 2. Eric Du

I'm very sorry professor, I was unable to complete either of the two version of the assignment, both the programming and storyboard versions. I have reached my physical and mental limits, and my virtual mac computer session keeps ending before I find any meaningful progress.

My storyboard attempt only contains the storyboard's progress. The program will no longer compile in its current state. I'm so sorry, Professor.
